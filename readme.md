<h1 align="center">PopUp Cities I Went</h1>

## Short Description
To better visualize which city or attraction I have ever been, I create this simple web application. The markers are able to distinguish the categories of the places. Also, Clicking on the marker will PopUp the photo I take at that specific place. Any suggestion for this application would be appreciated. :)
